                    Scientific foundation models extend the breakthroughs of large language models and computer vision into science.
                    Trained on massive unlabeled scientific data, including experiments, simulations, papers, instrument logs, they learn generalizable, transferable knowledge across chemistry, materials, biology, and beyond without task-specific supervision.
                    Coupled with AI agents that can plan experiments, run tools, and interpret results, they accelerate discovery from hypothesis generation to validation.

                    According to GPT-5, the words ‘Scientific Foundation Models’ first appeared on the internet in July 2023. If this is accurate, we were among the first to introduce this term.

                    <p>
                        We are a multidisciplinary team combining expertise in physics, chemistry, materials science, and computer science. Our group brings together PIs, postdocs, and students from Michigan, along with our collaborators across the globe, to build foundation models that are scalable and practically useful. We collaborate closely with domain experts to ensure models respect scientific constraints, are interpretable, and can be integrated directly into experimental and simulation workflows.

                    <p>
                        Build and deploy scientific foundation models and AI agents that not only support research but actively generate new hypotheses, automate complex workflows, and deliver actionable solutions to pertinent scientific challenges.
