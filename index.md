Scientific Foundations Models --- an initiative in the [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery and Engineering (MICDE)][micde] at the [University of Michigan](https://umich.edu), launched in partnership with [Deep Forest Sciences][DFS] --- aims to leverage large amounts of unlabelled data available in scientific domains to develop scientific foundation models enabling Generative AI for materials design and towards autonomous scientific discovery agents.

## Vision
The advent of Scientific Foundation Models (SciFMs) heralds a transformative era in research and innovation, representing a paradigm shift in how scientific inquiry and application are conducted. SciFMs are based on large-scale generative AI models that can be adapted to several downstream tasks in scientific discovery, and medical and engineering innovations. The opportunity presented by SciFMs lies in their potential to serve as comprehensive platforms for interdisciplinary collaboration, seamlessly integrating diverse knowledge domains and enabling unprecedented levels of cooperation across the global scientific community. These models have the potential to accelerate discoveries and technological advancements, bridging gaps between theoretical research and practical applications, and catalyzing progress in addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time.
