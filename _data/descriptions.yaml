    MICDE recently organized the [SciFM conference](https://micde.umich.edu/event/conference-symposiumscifm24-conference-2/) and had an incredible reception for the event.  
    Based on the feedback from that meeting and further discussions with National Lab and academic partners, 
    we are excited to organize the SciFM Summer School from July 8 to July 26. 
    We wish for this to be a recurring event hosted at different locations across the country. 
    The first instance is going to be run in parallel at the University of Michigan (UM) and at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). 
    
    The summer school will:

    - Develop technical **plans for specific instances** of SciFMs; 

    - Involve a **hackathon** to jumpstart the construction of SciFMs; 

    - Act as an **incubator** for ideas; 

    - Serve as a **training ground for researchers and students**; 

    - Further a vision for a **national SciFM ecosystem**.

    The advent of Scientific Foundation Models (SciFMs) heralds a transformative era in research and 
    innovation, representing a paradigm shift in how scientific inquiry and application are conducted. 
    SciFMs are based on large-scale generative AI models that can be adapted to several downstream tasks
    in scientific discovery, and medical and engineering innovations. 
    The opportunity presented by SciFMs lies in their potential to serve as comprehensive platforms  
    for interdisciplinary collaboration, seamlessly integrating diverse knowledge domains and enabling 
    unprecedented levels of cooperation across the global scientific community. 
    These models have the potential to accelerate discoveries and technological advancements, 
    bridging gaps between theoretical research and practical applications, 
    and catalyzing progress in addressing some of the most pressing challenges of our time.
