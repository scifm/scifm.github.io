We've been awarded the 2023 Catalyst Grant by [Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery & Engineering](https://micde.umich.edu/catalyst-grants/).
For this grant, MICDE looks to fund "innovative research projects in computational science that combine elements of mathematics, computer science, and cyber-infrastructure."
Thanks to this grant we're developing scaling laws for training [LLMs for Molecular Discovery]({% link _projects/a_catalyst.md %}) using [Wafer-Scale Computing](https://www.cerebras.net/product-chip/).
