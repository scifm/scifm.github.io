We've been selected for the [2024 INCITE Award](https://www.doeleadershipcomputing.org/about) and have been awarded **200,000 node-hours** on [Polaris](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/polaris) at the [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.alcf.anl.gov)!
Using this grant we'll train a [BERT-based LLM]({% link _projects/a_catalyst.md %}) on 49B molecules to reach quantum-accuracy for molecular property prediction.
