We are excited to organize the SciFM Summer School from July 8 to July 26. The focus will be on developing technical plans for specific instances for SciFMs; a hackathon to jumpstart the construction of SciFMs; as an incubator for ideas; a training ground for researchers and students; and to further a vision for a national SciFM ecosystem.
