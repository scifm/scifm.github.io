We're thrilled to announce Microsoft Research's support for our work [Leveraging In-Context-Learning of Foundation Models for Accelerated Battery Materials Design](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/collaboration/accelerating-foundation-models-research/phase-ii/) during Phase II of their initiative.
As part of this award, we've received credits on the Azure Cloud and Azure OpenAI, which we're using to probe the use of foundation models for battery material design.
