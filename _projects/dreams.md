{% capture hero_body %}
The search for next-generation batteries, catalysts, and alloys depends on Density Functional Theory (DFT) — one of the most accurate ways to predict material properties. But DFT is notoriously demanding: every calculation can take hours, and even experts spend years learning to set parameters, test convergence, and fix subtle errors.

**DREAMS** is a *hierarchical, multi-agent framework* that couples large language model (LLM) reasoning with scientific tools, enabling autonomous, high-fidelity simulation with minimal human input.

{% capture workflows_body %}
Traditional computational workflows are static — scripts that execute predefined tasks. They cannot adapt, reason, or recover from unforeseeable failure. **DREAMS transforms this process into a coordinated team of specialized agents**, each handling a core aspect of the research cycle — planning, simulation, resource allocation, convergence handling, and data exchange.

- **Supervisor Agent**: Plans and dynamically updates tasks based on progress and results.
- **DFT Agent**: Generates atomic structures, optimizes convergence parameters, and parses outputs.
- **HPC Agent**: Allocates cluster resources, submits jobs, and monitors runs.
- **Convergence Agent**: Diagnoses and resolves failed or unconverged simulations.
- **Canvas**: A shared memory system linking all agents, tools, and users — preserving structured context and eliminating hallucination.

{% capture platform_body %}
Beyond DFT, DREAMS represents a **template for agentic science**. Its architecture generalizes to molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo, and generative materials discovery. By coordinating reasoning, computation, and error recovery through a shared Canvas, DREAMS moves beyond automation to genuine *scientific cognition*.

DREAMS bridges three worlds:

1. **Physics**: rigorous DFT fidelity.
2. **AI**: LLM reasoning and hierarchical planning.
3. **HPC**: scalable execution across clusters.

It transforms how scientific computation is performed — from manual scripts to intelligent, adaptive agents that learn and reason with physics in mind.
